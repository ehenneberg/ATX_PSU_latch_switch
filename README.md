# ATX_PSU_latch_switch
This is a simple circuit to control an ATX power supply with a push button.

The ATX PSU is normally controlled by the ATX motherboard, but for my
retro AT motherboard build, I made this small circuit with an Attiny25/45/85.

A short power button push activates the ATX PSU, and 1.5 sec. button push
shuts down the ATX PSU. Somewhat similar to the way an ATX PSU is controlled
by an ATX/ITX motherboard.

Atmel Studio 7 is used for compiling and flashing the Attiny.
