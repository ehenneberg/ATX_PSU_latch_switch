# ATX_PSU_latch_switch
This is a simple circuit to control an ATX power supply with a push button.

The ATX PSU is normally controlled by the ATX motherboard, but for my
retro AT motherboard build, I made this small circuit with an Attiny25/45/85.

Atmel Studio 7 is used for compiling and flashing the Attiny.
